# Wine Tasting Analysis

## :pushpin: Abstract
This project aims to analyze if wine prices are based on wine points, to identify the similarity in prices and ratings of the east world and west world wines. It consists of identifying the relationships between different variables, exploratory data analysis, and the interpretations of hypothesis testing. 

Note: The data set used can be found in the assets folder. 

## :bulb: Features
For this project, R programming language was used on RStudio. In this, the following packages were used for analyzing and visualizing the data:
* dplyr
* tidyr
* magrittr
* ggplot2
* tidyverse
* ggrepel
* gmodels
* sqldf
* ggpubr
* GGally

## :sparkles: Questions Explored
* Does points have a relation with wine pricing?
* Does direction have a relation with wine pricing?
* Does direction have a relation with wine rating?
* Does the mean price differ for wines produced in east world countries and the west world countries?
* Does the mean rating differ for wines produced in east world countries and the west world countries?
* Are the mean average points of wine equal to 85?
